# GIE-Parser-GenAI-Approach

Overall, the goal of the project is to build a system that can:
    * Reverse engineer data-points from graphÂ 
    * Create aural representations of the data


By building this application we are trying to address the problem of making online graph more accessible. The application is meant for individuals such as scientists, teachers, and webmasters interested in improving the accessibility of their graphs.
